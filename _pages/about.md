> California Polytechnic State University, Pomona

The Cal Poly Pomona CCDC and CPTC teams are student-led, student-managed, and student-taught teams that exemplify the learn by doing mantra. We always strive for excellence.

## How can I get involved?

Every summer, the CPP Cyber teams host tryouts for CCDC and CPTC. In order to prepare students for the tryouts, bootcamps for the respective competition are held throughout July and August. The easiest way to get involved with the bootcamps is to join the Discord server and check out the latest updates.
