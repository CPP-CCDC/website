# End of an Era

The 2022 CPP Cyber CCDC/CPTC Bootcamps have finally come to a close. Today marks the final meeting for both bootcamps and all that remains is the final tryouts. This was the first in-person/hybrid bootcamp since the advent of the global pandemic. We met so many new faces both in-person and on Zoom. While the teams faced countless challenges to ensure that the bootcamps were held as smooth as possible, we couldn't have imagined how great it would truly be. We hope everyone enjoyed their time with us and learned something new.

# The Loom of Tryouts

Keep those firewalls up, keep those services running, and, most importantly, keep red team out! Tryouts start next week with CPTC tryouts spanning August 20th 10AM to August 21st 11:59PM (PST). CCDC tryouts are August 27th from 11AM to 6PM (PST). 

Who will qualify? Who will prepare themselves the most? Find out next time on the next episode of CPP Cyber!

Best of luck to all of those who tryout!
