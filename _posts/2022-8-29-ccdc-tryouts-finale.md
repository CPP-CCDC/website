# Announcement

The CPP CCDC team has concluded its bootcamp with the 2022 CCDC tryouts. Although there was a strong showing from many students, there was a record number of tryout participants but only 6 spots available. For those who did not make it on the team, keep your heads high as you continue to develop into the world's next generation of cybersecurity professionals! We are planning on collaborating with CPP clubs to provide more opportunities to refine your skills throughout the year, so keep your eyes peeled. 

# Welcoming our Newest Members!

**Captain:** Gabriel Fok

**Members:** Dylan Tran, Evan Deters, Jacob Jayme, Jessica Leung, Justin Covairt, Jimmy Peng, Karina Rivera, Marshall Ung, Sydney Duong

Best of luck in the 2022-2023 CCDC season!
