# Announcement

The CPP CPTC team has concluded its bootcamp with the 2022 CPTC tryouts. Although there was a strong showing from many students, there was a record number of tryout report submissions but only 4 spots available. For those who did not make it on the team, keep your heads high as you continue to develop into the world's next generation of penetration testers! We are planning on collaborating with CPP clubs to provide more opportunities to refine your skills throughout the year, so keep your eyes peeled.
