# FAQ

## What's the difference between CCDC and CPTC?

Here at CPP, we have two cyber teams: CCDC and CPTC. Both teams are designed to help you learn about cybersecurity, but they do so in different ways.

The Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) is a blue team competition. Teams of students are given a network to defend against a red team of offensive security professionals. Think of it as "you build and defend" a home.

The Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC) is a penetration testing competition. Teams of students are given a network to attack and exploit. Think of it as "you break and enter" a home.

## What's the difference between CCDC and CPTC bootcamps?

Both bootcamps are designed with the same guiding principles. If you participate in both, you'll see they present different content in approximately the same way. 

## I don't go to CPP. Can I still participate?

Yes. We welcome students from all schools.
