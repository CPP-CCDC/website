## Homework Grading Rubric
Homework will be graded on completeness, accuracy, and originality. All assignments will be due on a Friday anywhere-on-Earth (which ends up being 5AM PST). With this policy, if it is Friday for you anywhere in the world, you can turn it in.

**Completeness:** Was the homework submitted in full? Have all parts been properly addressed and covered? Is the submission on-time or otherwise excused?

**Accuracy:** Are the graded elements of the submission accurate? Can the student's answers be repeated or explained further?

**Originality:** Does the homework show the student's own interpretations, efforts, and research? Is the submission styled appropriately?

## Tryout Grading Rubric
Tryouts will be scored on service uptime, red team defense, injects, and professionalism.

**Service Uptime:** The number of checks each service passed compared to the number of checks each service failed.

**Red Team Defense:** A measure of how effective the participant's defenses were against the red team.

**Injects:** The combined scores of injects during the tryouts (graded similarly as homework).

**Professionalism:** Scored based on the professionalism of interactions the participant had with tryout organizers during the tryout.

## Teamwork Grading Rubric
Teamwork scores will be derived by the team's combined observations on each participant's sportsmanlike conduct and team attitude.

**Sportsmanlike Conduct:** Contributing to the overall success of the bootcamp, peers, or community at large. 

**Team Attitude:** Contributing to a welcoming, friendly, and productive team environment.

## Team Selection Rubric
Team members will be selected based on a composite score of several categories. For fairness, selection for the team will be based upon your final score from the rubric below. No other factors are used for team selection.
